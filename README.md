# Google Bard API

## Description
**@rehat666/bard-api** is a Node.js library for interacting with Bard, an AI Chatbot developed by Google. Bard is based on Google's Large language model (LLM), LaMDA, which is designed to generate human-like text and images in response to prompts.

## What is Bard?
Bard is basically an AI Chatbot developed by Google. It is based on Google‚Äôs Large language model (LLM), LaMDA, similar to how ChatGPT is based on GPT. These are types of neural networks that mimic the underlying architecture of the brain in the form of a computer. Bard is separate from Google Search, which is the default way how billions of people look for information on the web. Unlike how a traditional search works, Bard is conversational and allows users to write a prompt and receive human-like text and images generated by artificial intelligence.

In its own description, Bard is a ‚Äúlarge language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.‚Äù
